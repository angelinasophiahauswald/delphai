Kristian Kassow was working on an analysis of the requirements for robots in the food industry. Meanwhile, Esben \u00d8stergaard and Kasper St\u00f8y were working on a PhD project about the market for robots. Together, they discovered that the robotics market is characterised by heavy, expensive, and unwieldy robots. Based on their experience, they decided, with help from investor Syddansk Innovation, to establish Universal Robots with the intention of making robot technology available to all. In 2008, the Danish state investment fund saw the potential in the company and,together with Syddansk Innovation and the company\u2019s management, they invested DKK 10 million in the business."

Kristian Kassow was working on an analysis of the requirements for robots in the food industry. Meanwhile, Esben \u00d8stergaard and Kasper St\u00f8y were working on a PhD project about the market for robots. Together, they discovered that the robotics market is characterised by heavy, expensive, and unwieldy robots. Based on their experience, they decided, with help from investor Syddansk Innovation, to establish Universal Robots with the intention of making robot technology available to all. In 2008, the Danish state investment fund saw the potential in the company and,together with Syddansk Innovation and the company\u2019s management, they invested DKK 10 million in the business."
